*Ensuring academic integrity in online exams through AI-powered proctoring.*

## 📝 Overview

The **AI-Based Online Cheating Prevention System** is an intelligent proctoring solution designed to maintain fairness and integrity during online examinations. With the rise of remote learning, ensuring secure virtual assessments has become a critical challenge. This system leverages advanced artificial intelligence techniques to monitor candidates in real time, detect cheating behaviors, and enforce exam rules, reducing the need for human invigilators while fostering trust in digital education.

The system integrates multiple detection modules—**object detection (YOLOv5)**, **face detection (MTCNN)**, and **audio detection (YAMNet)**—alongside system control mechanisms to create a comprehensive invigilation framework. It monitors for prohibited items (e.g., mobile phones, books), ensures the candidate’s presence, detects suspicious sounds (e.g., speech, whispering), and enforces rules like fullscreen mode and shortcut restrictions. A user-friendly interface built with **PyQt5** displays live webcam feeds, violation counts, and warnings, empowering proctors to oversee exams effectively.

## 🚀 Features

- **Object Detection**: Identifies prohibited items like mobile phones and books using YOLOv5 with a custom-trained model (`best.pt`).
- **Face Detection**: Ensures the candidate’s presence and flags multiple faces using MTCNN, preventing impersonation.
- **Audio Detection**: Detects suspicious sounds like speech or whispering using YAMNet, with a lowered threshold for improved sensitivity.
- **System Control**: Enforces exam rules using `QWebEngineView`, maintaining fullscreen mode and disabling shortcuts (e.g., Alt+Tab, F11).
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays live webcam feeds, violation counts, and warnings in a PyQt5-based interface.
- **Violation Handling**: Implements a 15-second cooldown between violations and ends the test after 10 violations.
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduces webcam update rate to 10 FPS, lowers resolution to 160x120, and adjusts detection frequencies for smooth performance.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple candidates, making it suitable for large-scale institutional assessments.
- **Transparency**: Logs violations with timestamps for post-exam review and dispute resolution.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher 
- A webcam and microphone
- Internet connection (for initial package installation)

### Steps to run this project
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishal017/cheatshield.git
   cd AI-Based-Online-Cheating-Prevention-System
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   ***For Windows***
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   ***For Mac***
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```

   ```
4. **Run the project**  
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

  ## 🖥️ Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `main.py` to start the proctoring system.  
2. **Exam Setup**: The system loads the exam website in a `QWebEngineView` window, enforcing fullscreen mode and disabling shortcuts.  
3. **Monitoring**: The PyQt5 interface displays the webcam feed, violation count, and warnings in real-time.  
4. **Violation Handling**:  
   - Issues warnings for detected violations (e.g., mobile phone detected, multiple faces, speech).  
   - A **15-second cooldown** prevents rapid triggers.  
   - The test **ends after 10 violations**.  
5. **End Test**:  
   - The test can be ended **manually via a password-protected dialog** or **automatically after 10 violations**.  
   - Violations are logged in the `logs/` directory with timestamps.

## 🔍 Challenges and Solutions

- **High Resource Usage**  
  - **Solution**: Reduced webcam FPS (`10`), lowered resolution (`160x120`), and optimized detection frequencies (`every 8th frame` for object/face detection, `every 5 seconds` for audio).  

- **Misclassification in Object Detection**  
  - **Solution**: Improved by setting confidence thresholds (`0.4` for mobile phones, `0.2` for books) and using a **custom-trained YOLOv5 model**.  

- **White Box Issue in UI**  
  - **Solution**: Made the warning display (`QWebEngineView`) **transparent** in the PyQt5 interface.  

- **Noisy Audio Environments**  
  - **Solution**: Lowered **YAMNet speech detection threshold** (`0.3`) and added **debug prints** to verify audio capture.
